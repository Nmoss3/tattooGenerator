## Purpose

Tattoos are a popular form of self-expression.

Choosing body art that is meaningful to you takes

time and brainstorming. A great source of visual

inspiration is a photo sharing website like Flickr

or Pixabay. By looking at images that interest you

when the time comes to get inked you’ll have plenty of

ideas to work with. Search for images from multiple

websites in one place and find your next inkspiration

that you’ll love for the rest of your life!
